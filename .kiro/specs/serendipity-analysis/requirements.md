# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Serendipity Analysis feature enables users to discover hidden connections, patterns, and insights within their accumulated thoughts and conversations through AI-powered analysis. This feature transforms the user's memory data into meaningful discoveries by identifying non-obvious relationships, recurring themes, and cross-domain connections that might otherwise remain unnoticed. The system integrates seamlessly with the existing Synapse project architecture, providing a sophisticated cognitive analysis engine that enhances the user's understanding of their own thought patterns and intellectual journey.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the cognitive dashboard, I want to initiate a serendipity analysis with a single button click, so that I can easily discover hidden connections in my thoughts without complex interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the /dashboard URL THEN the system SHALL display a "Discover Connections" button prominently on the page
2. WHEN the user clicks the "Discover Connections" button THEN the system SHALL immediately disable the button and display a loading message
3. WHEN the analysis is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the process has started
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL re-enable the "Discover Connections" button for future use

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to analyze my entire memory history, so that the serendipity analysis can identify connections across all my past thoughts and conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a serendipity analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL load and process the complete memory.json file
2. IF the memory contains fewer than 3 insights THEN the system SHALL return a message indicating insufficient data for analysis
3. WHEN processing memory data THEN the system SHALL include both insights and conversation summaries in the analysis
4. WHEN formatting data for AI analysis THEN the system SHALL structure the memory content into a coherent text block

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to perform deep analysis using specialized prompts, so that the discovered connections are meaningful and non-obvious.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data to the AI THEN the system SHALL use a specialized prompt that instructs the AI to act as an expert in finding non-obvious connections
2. WHEN constructing the AI prompt THEN the system SHALL include examples of what to look for including hidden themes, contradictions, and cross-domain ideas
3. WHEN requesting AI analysis THEN the system SHALL specify that results must be returned in a strict JSON format
4. WHEN the AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL receive structured data including connections, patterns, and recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the analysis results displayed in an organized and visually appealing format, so that I can easily understand and explore the discovered connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are received THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON response into structured data
2. WHEN displaying connections THEN the system SHALL show each connection with a title, description, and visual indicators for surprise and relevance
3. WHEN rendering results THEN the system SHALL dynamically generate HTML elements for connections, meta-patterns, and recommendations
4. WHEN the display is complete THEN the system SHALL replace any loading messages with the formatted results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully during the analysis process, so that I receive clear feedback if something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend encounters an error THEN the system SHALL send an appropriate error response to the frontend
2. WHEN the frontend receives an error response THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL re-enable the "Discover Connections" button
4. WHEN there is insufficient memory data THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on having more conversations to improve analysis quality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the analysis to include metadata about when it was performed and which AI model was used, so that I can track the context of my discoveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an analysis is completed THEN the system SHALL add a timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed
2. WHEN storing analysis results THEN the system SHALL record which AI model (llama3:8b) was used for the analysis
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the analysis context
4. WHEN multiple analyses are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain historical context for each analysis session

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the serendipity engine to integrate seamlessly with the existing Synapse project configuration, so that it can be easily enabled or disabled without affecting other system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL check for ENABLE_SERENDIPITY_ENGINE environment variable
2. IF ENABLE_SERENDIPITY_ENGINE is set to True THEN the system SHALL activate all serendipity analysis features
3. IF ENABLE_SERENDIPITY_ENGINE is not set or False THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable serendipity features
4. WHEN serendipity is disabled THEN the system SHALL hide UI components and return appropriate status messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the serendipity analysis to work responsively across all device sizes, so that I can discover connections whether I'm on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard on any device THEN the serendipity UI SHALL adapt to the screen size
2. WHEN viewing analysis results on mobile THEN connection cards SHALL stack vertically and remain readable
3. WHEN interacting with the feature on touch devices THEN all buttons and controls SHALL be appropriately sized
4. WHEN the analysis is running THEN loading states SHALL be clearly visible on all screen sizes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the serendipity analysis interface to be fully accessible, so that I can use screen readers and keyboard navigation to discover connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all serendipity UI elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable and operable
3. WHEN analysis results are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper heading hierarchy and semantic structure
4. WHEN loading states change THEN screen readers SHALL be notified of status updates
