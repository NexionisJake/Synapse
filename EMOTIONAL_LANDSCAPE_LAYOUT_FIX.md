# Emotional Landscape Chart Layout Fix

## Issue
The dominant emotion text in the emotional landscape doughnut chart was overlapping with the chart itself, making both elements difficult to read clearly.

## Solution
Repositioned the dominant emotion text from the center of the doughnut chart to the right side of the chart with a glassmorphism background panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Text Positioning Function
**File**: `synapse-project/static/js/cognitive-charts.js`
**Function**: `drawEmotionalLandscapeCenterText()`

**Changes**:
- Moved text position from chart center to right side (`chart.chartArea.right + 40`)
- Changed text alignment from `center` to `left`
- Added glassmorphism background panel for better readability
- Improved text styling with better shadows and spacing

### 2. Updated Chart Layout Padding
**File**: `synapse-project/static/js/cognitive-charts.js`
**Section**: Chart options layout configuration

**Changes**:
- Increased right padding from `20px` to `200px` to accommodate side text
- Maintained other padding values for consistent spacing

### 3. Enhanced CSS Styling
**Files**: 
- `synapse-project/static/css/style.css`
- `synapse-project/test_task8_complete.html`
- `synapse-project/test_emotional_landscape_chart.html`

**Changes**:
- Added specific styling for emotional landscape chart container
- Increased minimum width to `500px` for proper text display
- Increased chart height to `300px` for better proportions
- Updated test file containers to accommodate wider layout

### 4. Added Browser Compatibility
**File**: `synapse-project/static/js/cognitive-charts.js`

**Changes**:
- Added fallback for `ctx.roundRect()` method for older browsers
- Uses regular `ctx.rect()` if `roundRect` is not available

## Visual Improvements

### Before
- Text overlapped with doughnut chart segments
- Difficult to read both chart and dominant emotion information
- Poor visual hierarchy

### After
- ✅ Clear separation between chart and text
- ✅ Glassmorphism background panel for text readability
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy with side-by-side layout
- ✅ Enhanced styling with shadows and HUD theme colors
- ✅ Responsive design that maintains readability

## Text Panel Features

### Background Panel
- Glassmorphism effect with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` background
- Cyan border with `rgba(88, 166, 255, 0.3)` color
- Rounded corners (with fallback for older browsers)
- 160px width × 100px height dimensions

### Text Elements
1. **Label**: "DOMINANT EMOTION" in cyan (#58A6FF) with glow effect
2. **Emotion Name**: Large, bold text in primary text color (#C9D1D9)
3. **Percentage**: Cyan accent color with shadow effects

### Typography
- Font family: SF Pro Display with system fallbacks
- Consistent font weights and sizes for hierarchy
- Shadow effects for better contrast and HUD aesthetic

## Testing
Created dedicated test file: `test_emotional_landscape_side_text.html` to verify the layout improvements.

## Compatibility
- ✅ Works with all modern browsers
- ✅ Fallback support for older browsers without `roundRect`
- ✅ Responsive design maintains functionality on different screen sizes
- ✅ Maintains all existing chart functionality and interactivity

## Result
The emotional landscape chart now displays the dominant emotion information clearly on the right side of the chart, eliminating the overlay issue while maintaining the HUD aesthetic and all interactive features.
