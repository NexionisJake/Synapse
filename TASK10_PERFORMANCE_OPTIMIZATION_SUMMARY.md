- **Integration hooks** for custom optimization strategies

## Configuration Options

### Performance Thresholds
```javascript
config: {
    targetFrameRate: 60,           // Target FPS for smooth operation
    maxMemoryUsage: 100MB,         // Memory usage threshold
    maxRenderQueueSize: 50,        // Maximum render operations in queue
    cleanupInterval: 5 minutes,    // Automatic cleanup frequency
    performanceCheckInterval: 5s   // Performance monitoring frequency
}
```

### Conversation Management
```javascript
conversationConfig: {
    maxConversationLength: 100,    // Maximum messages to keep
    cleanupThreshold: 80%,         // Cleanup trigger percentage
    maxMessageAgeHours: 24,        // Maximum message age
    autoCleanupInterval: 5 minutes // Automatic cleanup frequency
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### 1. Test Suite (`test_performance_optimization.html`)
- **Frame throttling tests** to verify smooth rendering
- **Memory management tests** with mock data and cleanup
- **Render queue tests** including stress testing
- **Streaming optimization tests** with typewriter effects
- **Integration tests** for full system validation

### 2. Bug Fix Validation (`test_performance_fix.html`)
- **Fixed method call error** in `applyPerformanceOptimizations()`
- **Corrected conversation cleaner integration** using proper method names
- **Validated all components** work without runtime errors
- **Confirmed system stability** under normal operation

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Real-time monitoring** of system performance
- **Visual feedback** through debug displays
- **Automatic optimization** when thresholds are exceeded
- **Performance statistics** for analysis and tuning

## Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. Method Call Error Fix
- **Issue**: `this.conversationCleaner.cleanupIfNeeded()` method did not exist
- **Fix**: Changed to proper conditional check using `needsCleanup()` and `performCleanup()`
- **Result**: Eliminated runtime errors and restored proper functionality

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `static/js/performance-optimizer.js` - Main performance optimization system
- `test_performance_optimization.html` - Comprehensive test suite

### Modified Files
- `templates/index.html` - Added performance optimizer script inclusion
